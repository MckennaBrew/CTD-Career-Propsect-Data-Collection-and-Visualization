# Collectiviz

Created by Mckenna Brewer, Damean Rittman, and Ben Goldin

Collectiviz is a career data collection and visualization website to help ease prospective and current students' concerns about the CTD(Creative Technology and Design) program and its career prospects. 

The project is made up of two webpages. One web page is a form, built using a bootstrap framework, that collects alumni data in a comprehensive yet quick way. It aims to make the process of filling out a form less cumbersome, and automatically stores entered data in a realtime firebase database. The second web page is a visualization that can be accessed by anyone curious about the CTD career prospect. This page works by pulling data from firebase and formatting it into graphics using two chart based APIs.
